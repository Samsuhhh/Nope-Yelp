Nope is a fullstack web application, inspired by [Yelp](https://yelp.com). Visit our site as a passive user, active user, or business owner. As a business owner you can recieve feedback known as grumbles, dedicated to shedding light on how the business can improve. As an active user you can read, post, delete, and edit grumbles or become a business owner yourself! As a passive user you may not write grumbles but you may visit business pages to read grumbles.
